# Freeze Dryer

This project is an attempt to make a font development versioning and backup system that fits my needs. It is designed to:

1. Be simple to use.
2. Be agnostic about project structures.
3. Allow local or remote archiving.
4. Store states in a form that does not require this, or any other, tool to view or access the data.
5. Not try to be, or compete with, Git.

The storage system is entirely file based. It simply duplicates the contents of a project into a time stamped directory. It doesn't do any kind of merging or other sophisticated versioning system tasks.

## Duh. Just use Git.

I did. I *really, really, really* tried to use Git for font projects for several years, but it was way more complex than what I needed. It was like buying a cruise ship, staffing it with a full crew, stocking all the provisions, fueling it up and taking it out to sea just so that I could make a sandwich. Yeah, I could make a sandwich on the ship, but there are easier ways to make a sandwich.
